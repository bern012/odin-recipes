Creating a recipe website via Odin Project

This project will involve the development of a simple recipe website, using basic HTML and CSS skills. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated how to utilize basic HTML for the composition of a website. Then, basic CSS for the stylization of the website and its formatting.
